# Employee Directory

### Overview
View a company's entire employee directory at once using React to have quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The table can be sorted by a Last Name, A-Z and Z-A. Users can additionally use the Search bar to filter the names of employees.
