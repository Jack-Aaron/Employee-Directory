# Employee Directory

### Overview
View a company's entire employee directory at once using React to have quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The table can be sorted by a Last Name, A-Z and Z-A. Users can additionally use the Search bar to filter the names of employees.

### Development Process

Adding the Sorting mechanism was an interesting experiment in blending JavaScript logic with how React operates with JSX. It also required some thinking and tooling around with how to best represent a "sorting" affordance to a user.

Once I had the basic View set up using Reactstrap, I was able to further customize the styles of the model data to my liking.
